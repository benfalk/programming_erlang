Chapter Nine, Exercise Four
===========================

Experiment with opaque types. Create two modules; the first should export an
opaque type. The second module should use the internal data structures of the
opaque type exported by the first module in such a way as to cause an
abstraction violation. Run the dialyzer on the two modules and make sure you
understand the error messages.
