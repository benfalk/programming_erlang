Programming Erlang: Software for a Concurrent World (Exercises)
===============================================================

This is a collection of exercises that I have completed from
(this book)[http://goo.gl/xYyQ0d].  Each chapter I have done is in a seperate
directory, such as `chapter_1` etc.  I also plan to put notes in markdown
format that I pick up along the way in each chapter.  Eventually the more
important notes will be found in this readme.
